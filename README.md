## 🧠 Problem Statement

Agricultural Sensor Network + Aptos DApp  
Record soil and water data from IoT sensors to Aptos, traceable by buyers and regulators.   

### 💡 Proposed Solution

Our project integrates **IoT sensors** with the **Aptos blockchain** to build a decentralized, tamper-proof system for **agricultural data logging**. This enables:

- 📈 **Real-Time Monitoring** of environmental parameters  
- 🔐 **Secure and Immutable Data Storage** on the blockchain  
- 🌍 **Stakeholder Access via a Decentralized Application (DApp)**  

---

## 📝 Abstract

We propose a **Blockchain-Enabled Agricultural Sensor Network** that uses IoT devices to measure soil moisture, pH, temperature, and humidity in real time. This data is then **recorded on the Aptos blockchain**, ensuring **immutability, transparency, and accessibility** for:

- 👨‍🌾 Farmers
- 🏢 Buyers
- 🏛️ Regulators

By combining **sensor networks** with **decentralized ledger technology**, we aim to revolutionize agricultural data tracking with **trust, accountability, and efficiency**.

---

## 🚀 Use Cases

### 👨‍🌾 Farmer Optimizing Crop Yields
- Sensors detect low moisture & high pH
- Farmer irrigates or adjusts fertilization
- ✅ Improved crop health and yield

### 🛒 Buyer Verifying Product Quality
- Buyer checks blockchain records
- Confirms data meets sustainability standards
- ✅ Builds trust and ensures food quality

### 🏛️ Regulator Enforcing Environmental Standards
- Regulator audits blockchain data for compliance
- Verifies water usage and soil health
- ✅ Reduces fraud and ensures accountability

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

### 🔌 Hardware
- **IoT Sensors**: Soil Moisture, pH, Temperature, Humidity  
- **Raspberry Pi**: Central processing and sensor integration  

### 💻 Software
- **Python**: Sensor data reading and processing  
- **Aptos Blockchain**: Secure, immutable data storage  
- **Decentralized App (DApp)**: Interface for farmers, buyers, and regulators  

---

## 🔄 System Workflow

1. **Sensors collect data** → Soil moisture, pH, temperature, etc.  
2. **Raspberry Pi processes readings** using Python scripts  
3. **Data is pushed to Aptos blockchain** via smart contracts  
4. **DApp displays data** for real-time and historical access by stakeholders  

---

## 🌱 Vision

This project aims to create a **transparent, decentralized, and sustainable agriculture ecosystem** by blending **IoT-driven insights** with **blockchain integrity**. It empowers farmers, reassures buyers, and enables efficient regulatory oversight.
